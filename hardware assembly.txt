layout parts for mounting

run wires

solder ds18b
{
	"Red connects to +5V, Blue/Black connects to ground, and Yellow/White is data"
	data wire -> pin 11 + 4.7k pullup resistor to +5v
}

ssr activation leads
{
	black wire -> ground pin
	signal wire -> pin 3
	tinned ends
}

WARNING: MAINS VOLTAGE! splice heater wire into ssr (hot only)
{
	black color should be "hot", check continuity with plug end (narrow spade)
	all exposed wire and solder must be covered in heat shrink (600v min)
	tinned ends
}
